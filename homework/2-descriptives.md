For this homework assignment, create a new folder and save the `2-descriptives.Rmd` and `2-data.csv` files in it.

### Read the data

Read in the data file (`2-data.csv`) using the code below.

``` r
## read data into R
data <- read.csv("2-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## for the ID variable...how many people completed the survey twice?

## what is the min, max, mean, and standard deviation of each variable
```

Answer the following prompts by writing the appropriate code in the code chunks below each.

First, how many times did each participant complete the survey? *Hint: create a frequency table `table()` of the ID variable `data$id`.*

``` r
## your code goes here
```

Second, what is the mininum value, maximum value, mean, and standard deviation of each variable (all variables besides `id`)? Provide code below to print out the correct answers and/or write up the correct answer as text following the code chunk below.

``` r
## your code goes here
```
