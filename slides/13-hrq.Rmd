# Projects

**Items**: Using the research questions/hypotheses you uploaded to Canvas, I came up with a list of 13 hypotheses (in every instance; I modified the uploaded RQ/H).

**Task**: describe the unit of analysis, independent variable, dependent variable, and appropriate statistical test.

**Submit**: write these down on a piece of paper and submit the completed paper at the end of class. This will count as your final homework assignment.
