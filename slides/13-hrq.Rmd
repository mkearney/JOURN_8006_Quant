# Projects

**Items**: Using the research questions/hypotheses you uploaded to Canvas, I came up with a list of 13 hypotheses (in every instance; I modified the uploaded RQ/H).

**Task**: describe the unit of analysis, independent variable, dependent variable, and appropriate statistical test.

**Submit**: write these down on a piece of paper and submit the completed paper at the end of class. This will count as your final homework assignment.

# Parameters

**Unit of analysis**: the level, or description, at which observation occurs (e.g., people, news articles, news organizations, countries, etc.)

**Dependent (outcome) variable**: variable to be predicted; often assumed to be the "effect"

**Independent (predictor) variable**: variable used to make prediction; often assumed to be the "cause"

**Control (covariate) variable(s)**: variable(s) to include in model as controlsâ€“not explicit in hypothesis (only include if they make sense)

**Statistical test**: one of the statitical methods covered this semester

# Statistical tests

**chi-square** compare observed frequencies of two categorical variables

**t-test** compare two groups on a continuous variable

**Correlation** non-causal relationship between two continuous variables

**Regression** linear model with one or more continuous predictors

**ANOVA** linear model with only categorical predictors
