# Scientific research

---

## Research

- The text book defines **research** as

> an attempt to discover something.<br><cite>- Wimmer & Dominick, 2011, p. 2</cite>

---

## Scientific research

- The text book defines **scientific research** as

> Scientific research is an organized, objective, controlled,
> qualitative or quantitative empirical analysis of one or more
> variables.<br><cite>- Wimmer & Dominick, 2011, p. 9</cite>

---

## Methods of knowing

Four approaches to knowing: tenacity, intuition, authority, and science

- **Tenacity** - true because it always has been
- **Intuition** - true because it is self evidence
- **Authority** - true because qualified source says so
- **Scientific** - true because studies provisionally support it

---

## Characteristics of the scientific method

Wimmer and Dominick describe the following five characteristics of
the scientific method:

1. Scientific research is **public**
2. Science is **objective**
3. Science is **empirical**
4. Science is **systematic** and **cumulative**
5. Science is **predictive**

---

## Characteristics of the scientific method

Here's another list of five characteristics from [sciencing.com](https://sciencing.com/five-characteristics-scientific-method-10010518.html)

1. Scientific research is **empirical**
2. Scientific research is **replicable**
3. Scientific research is **provisional**
4. Scientific research is **objective**
5. Scientific research is **systematic**

---

## Theory

- The text book defines **theory** as

> a set of related propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relationships among concepts.<br><cite>- Wimmer & Dominick, 2011, p. 13</cite>

---

## Measurements of objectivity

- **Validity** refers to **accuracy** of findings
- **Reliability** refers to **consistency** of findings
