# Recap and overview

## Research designs
> + **Surveys**
>     - Good snapshot; hard to get representative sample
> + **Experiments**
>     - Test for causality; limited to certain IVs
> + **Content analysis**
>     - Convert content to numeric data; labour intensive
> + **Text analysis**

## Due today
+ Submit the current research question/hypothesis (can be plural) of your thesis/project

## Overview
+ **#rstats**: the R environment
    - What is R?
    - Why R?
    - How does one use R?
+ Some computing **basics**
    - File/directory awareness
    - Be kind to future you
+ Workshop/live R demo

# What is R?

## R
+ R is an **environment**
    - An interactive programming language
    - Integrates easily with other languages (c, c++, etc.)
+ The letter **R**
    - R was derived from the S language
    - It's an R-bitrary name

# Why R?

## R is gReat!

+ R is **open source**
    - It's free and available to the public
    - It's maintained by a group of benevolent super nerds
+ R is **flexible**
    - Academic origins have expanded to modern/practical applications
    - One of the two major data science languages

## Alternatives to R
+ Historically, this class features **SPSS**
    - SPSS is powerful and seemingly easy to use 
    - No scripting/coding required
+ There are downsides to SPSS, too
    - There are **too many** options to remember
    - Program defaults not always best
    - Data wrangling and non-statistical tasks remain tedious!
    - It costs lots of money!

# How does one use R?

## Installing R
**SEE: Instructions on Canvas**

+ R comes packaged with a GUI (graphical user interface), but **Rstudio** is a friendlier GUI
+ So, install R (the engine) but **use** Rstudio (the interface)

## Rstudio

+ Rstudio is a graphical interface (GUI) for R that offers numerous user-friendly features and makes using R a breeze
+ Rstudio is developed by people at the cutting edge of data science, but it's mostly designed for people who don't use R every day

# Computing basics

## File/directory awareness
- Every computer has a file/directory system
- There's a default or home folder
    - On PCs this might be the "C" folder. On Macs, this is your username.
- It's organized like a tree
    - You can move from one branch to another
    - Moving from one folder to another is a linear processâ€“meaning, you can go forward and backward

## Don't fall asleep yet!
- Why do you need to know about your computer's file directory system?
- Because you need to know where things are (i.e., data and script files) to interact with them

## tl;dr
- Open your file browser. See how the files are organized? Yeah? Good!

## Don't let these terms confuse you
- `File` is the **name**/location of a file
- `Path` is the name/**location** of a file
- `Folder` is the **name**/location of a file folder
- `Directory` is the name/**location** of a file folder

<p class="note">file == path & folder == directory</p>

# Be kind to future you

## The goldeR rule

> do unto others as you would have them do unto you

+ Do unto your future self way better than that!

## FutuRe you

+ Using scripts and writing clear code will make your life easier
+ It's like writing down a routine of pointing and clicking that you don't have to memorize
+ The internet is full of routines/scripts that you can edit and customize to your liking
+ With some notes and some extra attention paid to make sure things are clear, future you will be very happy with current you!

# Live R demo

+ Download R/Rstudio
