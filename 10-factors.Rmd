# Factor

A **factor** is a psychometric term for variable. 

In statistics, factors describe the **latent** variables which we are attempting to measure. 


---

# Items

An **item** refers to a single question/prompt/response-provoking stimulus in a questionnaire.

In the context of a study, a **variable** refers to a construct (or factor) to be examined.

Variables can consist of one or more items from a questionnaire.


---

# Multi-item variables

When a variable (or factor) is measured using multiple items, we still want to represent it with one number.

**How can we represent a variable measured with 5 likert-type items using one number per observation (respondent)?**


---

# Example

Our variable of interest is extraversion/introversion. We measure it using four likert-type items:

+ I like talking to lots of people
+ I like attending events where I meet knew people
+ I am comfortable at a party where I don't know anyone else
+ Meeting my friends' friends makes me nervous


---

# Example responses

```{r}
## first person's responses
person1 <- c(1, 2, 1, 7)

## second person's responses
person2 <- c(6, 6, 5, 2)
```


---

# Factor analysis

To make sure we have **reliable** measures, we use factor analysis.

**Factor analysis** essentially finds the correlation between responses for similar items. 

There are lots of details and variations, but knowing this much will help you in the future!
